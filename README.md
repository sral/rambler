rambler
=======

I'll let the rambler speak for itself through good ol' Hank:

> Some folks might say, God's blue sky. 
> Some folks might say that I gotta understand. 
> Just say, he made a ramblin' man. 
> Lord made a ramblin' man. 
> And if I love you gotta understand. 
> I can settle down and pack.

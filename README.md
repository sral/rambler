rambler
=======

I'll let the rambler speak for itself through good ol' Hank:

> Some folks might say, God's blue sky.<br />
> Some folks might say that I gotta understand.<br />
> Just say, he made a ramblin' man.<br />
> Lord made a ramblin' man.<br />
> And if I love you gotta understand.<br />
> I can settle down and pack.<br />
